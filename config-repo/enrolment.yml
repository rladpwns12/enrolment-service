      description: enrolment
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        request of student id will be registered for the course you are taking and return course information that you are taking.

        # Expected error responses
        1. If a enrolment with the same student id as specified in the posted information already exists,
          an <b>422 - Unprocessable Entity</b> error with a "You've already signed up for the course" error message will be returned

    delete-enrolment:
      description: Deletes a enrolment
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        Entities for enrolment information related to the specificed studentId and courseId will be deleted.
        The implementation of the delete method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called several times with the same response.
        This means that a delete request of a non existing enrolment will return <b>200 Ok</b>.
